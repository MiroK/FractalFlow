* Julia
  
** Topology

   1. [OK] number of loops
   2. [OK] loop basis
     - [!] as dict
     - [!] oriented values
   3. [OK] color_f
   4. [OK] number of colors

** Geometry
   1. length
   2. fractal dimension
   3. tortuosity
   4. longest branch

** Generation
   1. fractals
   2. random curves / calling gmsh

* Python

** Solver
   1. what should be the equations?
   2. what should be the monitored quantities, i.e. saturation, localization (how to get these)
   
* Julia/Python
  1. Automatize the mesh/curve gen -> solve -> quantities [save mesh, curve props, outputs]
  2. AI clasifier

* Julia
  
** Topology

   [OK] number of loops
   [OK] loop basis
     [!] as dict
     [!] oriented values
   color_f
   number of colors

** Geometry
   length
   fractal dimension
   tortuosity
   longest branch

** Generation
   fractals
   random curves / calling gmsh

* Python

** Solver
   what should be the equations?
   what should be the monitored quantities, i.e. saturation, localization (how to get these)

* Julia/Python
  Automatize the mesh/curve gen -> solve -> quantities [save mesh, curve props, outputs]

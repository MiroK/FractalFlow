* An example workflow for FractalFlow and localization

- FractalFlow is installed by issueing `Pkg.clone("https://github.com/MiroK/FractalFlow.git")` from withing Julia
- We use the module to generate a GEO file for [[http://gmsh.info/][GMSH]] which will describe a rectangle with a "crack" that is the desired curve, i.e. the mesh will conform to the curve. (The module also allows for studying properties of the curve such as fractal dimension and various topological properties). 
- The geo file is generated as follows [[https://github.com/MiroK/FractalFlow/blob/master/doc/julia.png]] where the curve is 
obtained by iterating 8 times the Koch quadratic type 1 fractal while the rectangle is obtained by padding the bouding box of 
the curve by (0.1, 0.1) in x direction (top, bottom) and (0.1, 0.1) in y direction (left, right).

- At this point you should have "levy.geo" in you working directory. Now you can launch GMSH and mesh the geometry using GUI. Alternatively the mesh can be generated from command line by `gmsh -2 levy.geo -clscale 0.125` or `gmsh -setnumber size 0.5 -setnumber fsize 1 levy.geo`. The former command scales the default parameter by `clscale` value, the latter then sets the mesh size at curve points and frame points to the given values.

- If successful, there is now `levy.msh` in the folder. [[https://github.com/MiroK/FractalFlow/blob/master/doc/mesh.png]]
This file needs to be converted for [[http://fenicsproject.org/][FEniCS]
Using `dolfin-convert levy.msh levy.xml` you should get 3 XML files
- The final step is updating FEniCS [[https://github.com/MiroK/FractalFlow/blob/master/src/fem/localization/hamiltonian.py][solver]] to use the generated XML data. This is a stub of an eigenvalue solver which computed first computes the (binary)  potential for the curve and then gets the smallest eigenvalues.
